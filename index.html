                  <p>I wanted to make a murder mystery for my DnD group. When the moment came and I started preparing for the session I found there is a lot of 
                    advice, but not a lot of easy inspiration. There are a few prepared adventures, and those are not very polished or detailed. I used some of 
                    them for inspiration and a base and stole some ideas from them. Maybe you can take mine and improve it to have fun with your players.</p>
                  <p>I had planned his for along time as I expected that one of my players would not attend at some point. Perfect opportunity to throw the 
                    characters into a pocket dimension for a one shot without advancing the main story. I gave one of them this book with empty pages and a 
                    whirlpool on the cover.</p>
                  <p>Make sure to have prepared statblocks for all the stuff they can encounter.</p>
                  <p>I was greatly inspired by the adventure called 
                    <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/181052/How-Not-to-Host-a-Murder-5e">"How not to host a murder mystery"</a></p>
                  <p>I have left out the names as I think it's easier to navigate the story since we are looking at it's structure and not for entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Everything starts in a whirlpool in the sea, hence the cover of the book. The characters are on a small ship with <victim> heading to the 
                    city on the coast. During the whirlpool another group of adventurers (goblins?), who read another book of the same type, are summoned on 
                    the ship. <victim>, <innocent> and his colleagues are on the ship, and the characters are offered to to stay in the <victim>'s mansion. 
                      They were all summoned because he found this book and wanted to figure it out so cast some spells and activated all the books. <victim> 
                        introduces <innocent> as his brave but foolish, quick to act apprentice.</p>
                  <p>The mansion, <victim> explains was built thanks to his father’s successful business of trading rapiers, short swords and daggers. His 
                    father died 6 years ago.</p>
                  <p>Garden:<br>
                      Morning glory - a flower that blooms in the morning because of sunlight and it’s petals are closed when in shadow or darkness; a 
                      letter is hidden under the open petals in the day, but when darkness makes them close it is easy to spot. The letter is written 
                      with the same handwriting as the book of the <killer>, it is to the girl of the apprentice saying that he will not give up on their 
                        love. This can be used to have the <killer> try to frame <innocent>.</p>
                  <p>Time before dinner: the players are invited to do something before it is time for dinner: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>With <killer> and <innocent> to practice spells [openly said] (so all 3 including the PC seem suspicious); <killer> doesn’t want 
                      to waste mana; The <innocent> calls <killer> by his middle-name. The other players will not know whom this name belongs when they see it.</li>
                    <li>With sister to show you around: offers a reward a knife from the father’s collection of rare craftsman knives [openly said] (so the 
                      sister and the PC sound suspicious) In private they find that one specific knife is missing from its stand - Lord Kelnor’s pearl dagger</li>
                    <li>With cook to help prepare the big dinner. [openly said]; In private he tells the motive of both <innocent> and <sister>. He is grumpy 
                      and very skilled with cutting meat with his knife; he says the sister has a necklace with a gem that allows her to seduce and control weak men</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The players are given the information separately through notes and they should get a bit confused and suspect each other.</p>
                  <p>Dining room:<br>
                      During dinner the characters can talk to <innocent>, <killer>, <victim>’s sister who is a paid assassin, the cook, the old nanny</p>
                  <p><killer> says he will go and help the cook to set up the table. <innocent> says that he will go and find the host <victim> because 
                    he should have been here already. He leaves the room and in a bit everyone hears him scream.</p>
                  <p><victim> is stabbed in the heart in his study. There is no weapon there. Actually the knife <killer> used was conjured by Spiritual weapon.</p>
                  <p><killer> points the finger at innocent and explains his motive. <innocent> explains that he had the choice to give up on his study, but 
                    made up his mind and was no longer interested in marrying the girl. <innocent> has a fresh letter to her stating that he will find a way to 
                    be with her and won’t give up on their love.</p>
                  <p>The real killer has to be found before sunrise otherwise the framed <innocent> will be hanged.</p>
                  <p><innocent> is a young novice, brave but foolish, quick to act. <victim> doesn’t let <innocent> marry the daughter of a blacksmith because 
                    she will distract him from his studies.</p>
                  <p>Cook - not speaking a lot / low voice / bitter</p>
                  <p>The study:<br>
                      Has a book with spells (belongs to:<killer>’s name on the inside cover), every page has notes in the margins. Some of the notes are 
                      crossed out and with another color and handwriting more notes are taken. The second notes match the handwriting on the papers on <victim>’s 
                      desk. On the spell Spiritual weapon there are a lot of scribbles and in all caps: HAVE TO ASK <killer’s middle name> HOW TO CAST THIS!</p>
                  <p>Trophies on a shelf saying: First place in spellcasting/conjuring/arcana competition - <victim></p>
                  <p>Building the structure of the mystery:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><innocent> has motive and opportunity(to go bring victim), but no means</li>
                        <li><killer> has motive(fame,praise), means(stabbing), opportunity(the fact that the apprentice and the sister now have a motive)</li>
                        <li>Cook has means(knife with blood), no motive and no opportunity</li>
                        <li>Sister has motive(she is younger and can inherit the mansion that she likes very much if her brother dies), but no means and no 
                          opportunity, but definitely suspicious being an assassin</li>
                        <li>Old nanny - no motive, no means, no opportunity</li>
                      </ul>
                  <p></p>

                  <p>Hello! Read on if you decided to switch to IntelliJ, set it up, make it comfortable and learn how to be more productive with it. 
                    This post covers some settings and custom shortcuts.</p>
                  <p>The first things that annoyed me were the popups in the top-right corner. To disable some of them:
                    'Event log' on the bottom-right (or Speech bubble icon) -> Settings. Disabling the balloons doesn't hide the
                    notifications from the event log, so you can check that if you need to.</p>
                  <p>Next up is removing the default comment generated at the top of a new class file.<br>
                    File -> Settings -> Editor -> File and Code Templates -> 'Includes' tab -> File header -> the comment is on the right
                    -> delete it.
                    If you would like to use this feature make sure to print the date in a less ambiguous format.</p>
                  <p>Another one is the vertical line in the editor that is set to 120 chars per line by default. To change the line
                    limit:
                    <br>File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Right margin columns.<br>
                    <i>The <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide</a> recommends a column limit of 100 chars.</i></p>
                  <p>Ok hotkeys. Some are very hard to reach, hard to learn or conflict with something else. Here are some recommendations
                    how to make your life easier. You don't need to remove the old shortcut, so if someone else wants to use your Idea they
                    can still use the default keys they know. Go to <br>File -> Settings -> Keymap<br> and find the ones you need to change, then click on
                    them and select 'Add keyboard shortcut'. All of the recommended ones are unused and should be added as alternatives. For each
                    entry I have specified: the name of the command, the default shortcut, the suggested one and an explanation.</p>
                  <p><b>Rename:</b> default - Shift F6, suggested - Alt R. This default key is famous for being so hard to reach. Usage of
                    rename should be encouraged as naming things is one of the hardest tasks in programming. Remember it as R stands for rename.</p>
                  <p><b>Find usage:</b> default - Alt F7, suggested - rightAlt U. Shows you where a method/variable is used. One hand -
                    easy. Associate U with usage.</p>
                  <p><b>Surround with...:</b> default - Ctrl Alt T, suggested - Alt T. Surrounds the selected code with
                    if/elseif/while/for/try... etc. Some Linux distros have the terminal shortcut bound to Ctrl Alt T so that causes a conflict. Even if you don't care about
                    that the alternative is still 1 less key to press.</p>
                  <p><b>Delete line at caret:</b> default - Ctrl Y, suggested - Alt X. In Eclipse it was easy to Ctrl D with one hand, but
                    Ctrl Y requires both hands. The Alt and X keys are next to each other and this one is very easy to press. The X can be associated with
                    double-crossing something.</p>
                  <p><b>Run:</b> default - Alt Shift F10, suggested - Alt P. Usefulness depends on how often you run the project. P as in
                    play for the green arrow icon. An even easier variant is Alt E as in execute.</p>
                  <p>Next, I have compiled a list of the more notable shortcuts. Some are based on people's opinion from Stackoverflow. A
                    more complete list can be found <a href="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf">here</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/win/IntelliJ.html">here</a>
                    and you can always check the key for actions by pressing Ctrl Alt A in Idea.</p>

                  <p>Until the 1960s scientists could not explain how termites manage to organise their activity to gather and pile up
                    in one place all the wood pieces they find. Different theories tried to explain this like unaudible languages, but
                    the truth was that they just followed simple rules, from which emerged a complex behaviour.</p>
                  <p>By taking a piece of wood when they encounter it and dropping it when they encounter another one the termites
                    move the pieces to one or more piles, which in turn also get combined into bigger piles. The result is cleared
                    areas and compact piles.</p>

                  purpose of getting something for it. This combined with the lack of epicness of the setting made it feel more ordinary and calm.
